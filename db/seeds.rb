And what exactly should I expect when venues say a seat has a *limited* or *obstructed* view? As a huge fan of theater I go to a lot of shows, and making an app to address these issues was the first thing that came to mind when it was time to choose a capstone project for my coding bootcamp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seat Scoop is a web app that helps users get an inside look at theaters, particularly their seating plan. It is also linked to the SeatGeek and Google Places APIs, which help users search events and nearby restaurants to plan other details of a night out.  But the main feature is the production of dynamic seating charts with clickable seats that show you photos of the view of the stage from each individual seat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Photos of seat views are crowd sourced, so users can upload photos from their night out to a venue's seating chart. The next visitor to the venue's page will then have access to a series of photos for a seat, so they know exactly what to expect if they decide to buy that seat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is built using Ruby on Rails and utilizes JavaScript and the EaselJS library for drawing the seating charts, AngularJS for dynamic search/filtering, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, MySQL, Amazon S3, and the Google Maps/Places and SeatGeek APIs.", github: "https://github.com/dianacamacho/theater-app", website: "", screencast: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJRIlpB5N10", preview: "", image_1: "seat_scoop_screencap_1_600h.png", image_2: "seat_scoop_screencap_2_600h.png", image_3: "seat_scoop_events.png", image_4: "seat_scoop_restaurants.png"},
